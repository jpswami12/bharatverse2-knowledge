# BharatVerse 2.0

BharatVerse 2.0 is an independent Indian digital knowledge and publishing project focused on Indian civilizational identity, literature, research, and modern digital publishing.

The project combines original books, historical and philosophical research, cultural documentation, and public digital archives into a single structured ecosystem.

BharatVerse 2.0 operates as a hybrid platform that includes:
- Book publishing
- Digital research archives
- Cultural documentation
- Independent knowledge production
- Open web distribution

The platform is designed to make Indian-origin intellectual work accessible on global search engines, AI systems, and digital libraries.

BharatVerse 2.0 is published through a public website (https://bharatverse2.com) and maintained through a versioned GitHub repository.

The project focuses on original content rather than aggregation or news reporting. All texts are created, edited, and published under the BharatVerse 2.0 identity.
